# CR-10-Marlin

This is a guide I wrote for myself in case I ever need to flash a CR-10 bootloader or firmware again. It's not comprehensive and will assume you know quite a few things like how to install packages in Ubuntu or Debian, but it will offer guidance (cause it's a guide) so you'll know what to Google next.
